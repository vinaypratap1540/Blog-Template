        <h3 style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: georgia;">Who Is Elon Musk?</span></h3>
        <p><span style="font-family: georgia;"><a href="https://www.forbes.com/profile/elon-musk/?sh=51c2399b7999"
                    rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><b>Elon Musk</b></a> is a South African-born American entrepreneur
                and businessman who founded <u>X.com in 1999</u> (<i>which later became PayPal</i>), <u>SpaceX in
                    2002</u> and <u>Tesla Motors in 2003</u>. Musk became a multimillionaire in his late 20s when he
                sold his start-up company, Zip2, to a division of Compaq Computers.&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-family: georgia;"><span style="background-color: #fcff01;">Musk made headlines in May 2012,
                    when SpaceX launched a rocket that would send the first commercial vehicle to the International
                    Space Station.</span> He bolstered his portfolio with the purchase of SolarCity in 2016 and cemented
                his standing as a leader of industry by taking on an advisory role in the early days of President Donald
                Trump's administration.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-family: georgia;">In January 2021, Musk reportedly surpassed Jeff Bezos as the wealthiest
                man in the world.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-family: georgia;"><br /></span></p>
        <h3 style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: georgia;">Early Life</span></h3>
        <p><span style="font-family: georgia;">Musk was born on June 28, 1971, in <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretoria" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Pretoria</a>, South
                Africa. As a child, Musk was so lost in his daydreams about inventions that his parents and doctors
                ordered a test to check his hearing.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-family: georgia;">At about the time of his parents’ divorce, when he was 10, Musk developed
                an interest in computers. He taught himself how to program, and when he was 12 he sold his first
                software: a game he created called Blastar.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-family: georgia;">In grade school, Musk was short, introverted and bookish. He was bullied
                until he was 15 and went through a growth spurt and learned how to defend himself with karate and
                wrestling.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-family: georgia;"><br /></span></p>
        <h3 style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: georgia;">Family</span></h3>
        <p><span style="font-family: georgia;">Musk’s mother, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maye_Musk"
                    rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Maye Musk</a>, is a Canadian model and the oldest woman to star in a
                Covergirl campaign. <span style="background-color: #fcff01;"><b><u>When Musk was growing up, she worked
                            five jobs at one point to support her family.</u></b></span></span></p>
        <p><span style="font-family: georgia;">Musk’s father, Errol Musk, is a wealthy South African engineer.</span>
        </p>
        <p><span style="font-family: georgia;">Musk spent his early childhood with his brother Kimbal and sister Tosca
                in South Africa. His parents divorced when he was 10.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-family: georgia;"><br /></span></p>
        <h3 style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: georgia;">Education</span></h3>
        <p><span style="font-family: georgia;"><span style="background-color: #fcff01;">At age 17, in 1989, Musk moved
                    to Canada to attend Queen’s University and avoid mandatory service in the South African
                    military.</span> Musk obtained his Canadian citizenship that year, in part because he felt it would
                be easier to obtain American citizenship via that path.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-family: georgia;">In 1992, Musk left Canada to study business and physics at the University
                of Pennsylvania. He graduated with an undergraduate degree in economics and stayed for a second
                bachelor’s degree in physics.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-family: georgia;">After leaving Penn, Musk headed to Stanford University in California to
                pursue a PhD in energy physics. However, his move was timed perfectly with the Internet boom, and he
                dropped out of Stanford after just two days to become a part of it, launching his first company, Zip2
                Corporation in 1995. Musk became a U.S. citizen in 2002.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-family: georgia;"><br /></span></p>
        <h3 style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: georgia;">Zip2 Corporation</span></h3>
        <p><span style="font-family: georgia;"><span style="background-color: #fcff01;">Musk launched his first company,
                    Zip2 Corporation, in 1995 with his brother, Kimbal Musk. </span>An online city guide, Zip2 was soon
                providing content for the new websites of both The New York Times and the Chicago Tribune. In 1999, a
                division of Compaq Computer Corporation bought Zip2 for <b>$307</b> million in cash and <b>$34</b>
                million in stock options.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-family: georgia;"><br /></span></p>
        <h3 style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: georgia;">PayPal</span></h3>
        <p><span style="font-family: georgia;">In 1999, Elon and Kimbal Musk used the money from their sale of Zip2 to
                found X.com, an online financial services/payments company. An X.com acquisition the following year led
                to the creation of PayPal as it is known today.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-family: georgia;">In October 2002, Musk earned his first billion when PayPal was acquired
                by eBay for $1.5 billion in stock. Before the sale, Musk owned 11 percent of PayPal stock.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-family: georgia;"><br /></span></p>
        <h3 style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: georgia;">SpaceX</span></h3>
        <p><span style="font-family: georgia;"><span style="background-color: #fcff01;">Musk founded his third company,
                    Space Exploration Technologies Corporation, or SpaceX, in 2002 with the intention of building
                    spacecraft for commercial space travel.</span> By 2008, SpaceX was well established, and <b><a
                        href="https://www.nasa.gov/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">NASA</a></b> awarded the company the
                contract to handle cargo transport for the International Space Station—with plans for astronaut
                transport in the future—in a move to replace NASA’s own space shuttle missions.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-family: georgia;"><span style="background-color: #fcff01;">On May 22, 2012, Musk and SpaceX
                    made history when the company launched its Falcon 9 rocket into space with an unmanned
                    capsule.</span> The vehicle was sent to the International Space Station with <b>1,000 pounds</b> of
                supplies for the astronauts stationed there, marking the first time a private company had sent a
                spacecraft to the International Space Station.&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-family: georgia;"></span></p>
        <blockquote><span style="font-family: georgia;"><b><i>Of the launch, Musk was quoted as saying, "I feel very
                        lucky. ... For us, it's like winning the Super Bowl."</i></b></span></blockquote>
        <p></p>
        <p><span style="font-family: georgia;">In December 2013, a Falcon 9 successfully carried a satellite to
                geosynchronous transfer orbit, a distance at which the satellite would lock into an orbital path that
                matched the Earth's rotation. In February 2015, SpaceX launched another Falcon 9 fitted with the Deep
                Space Climate Observatory (DSCOVR) satellite, aiming to observe the extreme emissions from the sun that
                affect power grids and communications systems on Earth.</span></p>
        <p><span style="background-color: #fcff01; font-family: georgia;">In March 2017, SpaceX saw the successful test
                flight and landing of a Falcon 9 rocket made from reusable parts, a development that opened the door for
                more affordable space travel.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-family: georgia;">A setback came in November 2017, when an explosion occurred during a test
                of the company's new Block 5 Merlin engine. SpaceX reported that no one was hurt, and that the issue
                would not hamper its planned rollout of a future generation of Falcon 9 rockets.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-family: georgia;">The company enjoyed another milestone moment in February 2018 with the
                successful test launch of the powerful Falcon Heavy rocket. Armed with additional Falcon 9 boosters, the
                Falcon Heavy was designed to carry immense payloads into orbit and potentially serve as a vessel for
                deep space missions. For the test launch, the Falcon Heavy was given a payload of Musk's cherry-red
                Tesla Roadster, equipped with cameras to <b><u>"provide some epic views"</u></b> for the vehicle's
                planned orbit around the sun.</span></p>
        <p><span style="background-color: #fcff01; font-family: georgia;">In July 2018, Space X enjoyed the successful
                landing of a new Block 5 Falcon rocket, which touched down on a drone ship less than 9 minutes after
                liftoff.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-family: georgia;"><br /></span></p>
        <h3 style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: georgia;">BFR Mission to Mars</span></h3>
        <p><span style="font-family: georgia;">In September 2017, Musk presented an updated design plan for his BFR (an
                acronym for either "Big F---ing Rocket" or "Big Falcon Rocket"), a 31-engine behemoth topped by a
                spaceship capable of carrying at least 100 people. He revealed that SpaceX was aiming to launch the
                first cargo missions to Mars with the vehicle in 2022, as part of his overarching goal of colonizing the
                Red Planet.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-family: georgia;">In March 2018, the entrepreneur told an audience at the annual South by
                Southwest festival in Austin, Texas, that he hoped to have the BFR ready for short flights early the
                following year, while delivering a knowing nod at his previous problems with meeting deadlines.</span>
        </p>
        <p><span style="font-family: georgia;">The following month, it was announced that SpaceX would construct a
                facility at the Port of Los Angeles to build and house the BFR. The port property presented an ideal
                location for SpaceX, as its mammoth rocket will only be movable by barge or ship when completed.</span>
        </p>
        <p><span style="font-family: georgia;"><br /></span></p>
        <h3 style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: georgia;">Starlink Internet Satellites</span></h3>
        <p><span style="font-family: georgia;">In late March 2018, SpaceX received permission from the U.S. government
                to launch a fleet of satellites into low orbit for the purpose of providing Internet service. The
                satellite network, named Starlink, would ideally make broadband service more accessible in rural areas,
                while also boosting competition in heavily populated markets that are typically dominated by one or two
                providers.&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-family: georgia;"><span style="background-color: #fcff01;">SpaceX launched the first batch
                    of 60 satellites in May 2019, and followed with another payload of 60 satellites that
                    November.</span> While this represented significant progress for the Starlink venture, the
                appearance of these bright orbiters in the night sky, with the potential of thousands more to come,
                worried astronomers who felt that a proliferation of satellites would increase the difficulty of
                studying distant objects in space.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-family: georgia;"><br /></span></p>
        <h3 style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: georgia;">Tesla Motors</span></h3>
        <p><span style="font-family: georgia;"><u>Musk is the co-founder, CEO and product architect at Tesla Motors</u>,
                a company formed in 2003 that is dedicated to producing affordable, mass-market electric cars as well as
                battery products and solar roofs. Musk oversees all product development, engineering and design of the
                company's products.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-family: georgia;"><br /></span></p>
        <h3 style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: georgia;">Roadster</span></h3>
        <p><span style="font-family: georgia;">Five years after its formation, in March 2008, Tesla unveiled the
                Roadster, a sports car capable of accelerating from 0 to 60 mph in 3.7 seconds, as well as traveling
                nearly 250 miles between charges of its lithium ion battery.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-family: georgia;">With a stake in the company taken by Daimler and a strategic partnership
                with Toyota, Tesla Motors launched its initial public offering in June 2010, raising $226
                million.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-family: georgia;"><br /></span></p>
        <h3 style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: georgia;">Model S</span></h3>
        <p><span style="font-family: georgia;"><span style="background-color: #fcff01;">In August 2008, Tesla announced
                    plans for its Model S, the company's first electric sedan that was reportedly meant to take on the
                    BMW 5 series.</span> In 2012, the Model S finally entered production at a starting price of $58,570.
                Capable of covering 265 miles between charges, it was honored as the 2013 Car of the Year by Motor Trend
                magazine.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-family: georgia;">In April 2017, Tesla announced that it surpassed General Motors to become
                the most valuable U.S. car maker. The news was an obvious boon to Tesla, which was looking to ramp up
                production and release its Model 3 sedan later that year.</span></p>
        <p><span style="background-color: #fcff01; font-family: georgia;">In September 2019, using what Musk described
                as a "Plaid powertrain," a Model S set a speed record for four-door sedan at Laguna Seca Raceway in
                Monterey County, California.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-family: georgia;"><br /></span></p>
        <h3 style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: georgia;">Model 3</span></h3>
        <p><span style="font-family: georgia;">The Model 3 was officially launched in early 2019 following extensive
                production delays. The car was initially priced at $35,000, a much more accessible price point than the
                $69,500 and up for its Model S and X electric sedans.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-family: georgia;">After initially aiming to produce 5,000 new Model 3 cars per week by
                December 2017, Musk pushed that goal back to March 2018, and then to June with the start of the new
                year. The announced delay didn't surprise industry experts, who were well aware of the company's
                production problems, though some questioned how long investors would remain patient with the process. It
                also didn't prevent Musk from garnering a radical new compensation package as CEO, in which he would be
                paid after reaching milestones of growing valuation based on <b>$50 billion</b> increments.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-family: georgia;">By April 2018, with Tesla expected to fall short of first-quarter
                production forecasts, news surfaced that Musk had pushed aside the head of engineering to personally
                oversee efforts in that division. In a Twitter exchange with a reporter, Musk said it was important to
                "divide and conquer" to meet production goals and was "back to sleeping at factory."</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-family: georgia;">After signaling that the company would reorganize its management
                structure, Musk in June announced that Tesla was laying off 9 percent of its workforce, though its
                production department would remain intact. In an email to employees, Musk explained his decision to
                eliminate some "duplication of roles" to cut costs, admitting it was time to take serious steps toward
                turning a profit.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-family: georgia;">The restructuring appeared to pay dividends, as it was announced that
                Tesla had met its goal of producing<b> 5,000 Model</b> 3 cars per week by the end of June 2018, while
                churning out another 2,000 Model S sedans and Model X SUVs. "We did it!" Musk wrote in a celebratory
                email to the company. "What an incredible job by an amazing team."</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-family: georgia;">The following February, Musk announced that the company was finally
                rolling out its standard Model 3. Musk also said that Tesla was shifting to all-online sales, and
                offering customers the chance to return their cars within seven days or 1,000 miles for a full
                refund.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-family: georgia;"><br /></span></p>
        <h3 style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: georgia;">Semi Truck</span></h3>
        <p><span style="font-family: georgia;">In November 2017, Musk made another splash with the unveiling of the new
                Tesla Semi and Roadster at the company's design studio. The semi-truck, which was expected to enter into
                production in 2019 before being delayed, boasts 500 miles of range as well as a battery and motors built
                to last 1 million miles.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-family: georgia;"><br /></span></p>
        <h3 style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: georgia;">Model Y and Roadster</span></h3>
        <p><span style="font-family: georgia;">In March 2019, Musk unveiled Tesla’s long-awaited Model Y. The compact
                crossover, which began arriving for customers in March 2020, has a driving range of 300 miles and a 0 to
                60 mph time of 3.5 seconds.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-family: georgia;">The Roadster, also set to be released in 2020, will become the fastest
                production car ever made, with a 0 to 60 time of 1.9 seconds.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-family: georgia;"><br /></span></p>
        <h3 style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: georgia;">SolarCity</span></h3>
        <p><span style="font-family: georgia;">In August 2016, in Musk’s continuing effort to promote and advance
                sustainable energy and products for a wider consumer base, a $2.6 billion dollar deal was solidified to
                combine his electric car and solar energy companies. His Tesla Motors Inc. announced an all-stock deal
                purchase of SolarCity Corp., a company Musk had helped his cousins start in 2006. He is a majority
                shareholder in each entity.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-family: georgia;">“Solar and storage are at their best when they're combined. As one
                company, Tesla (storage) and SolarCity (solar) can create fully integrated residential, commercial and
                grid-scale products that improve the way that energy is generated, stored and consumed,” read a
                statement on Tesla’s website about the deal.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-family: georgia;"><br /></span></p>
        <h3 style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: georgia;">The Boring Company</span></h3>
        <p><span style="font-family: georgia;">In January 2017, Musk launched The Boring Company, a company devoted to
                boring and building tunnels in order to reduce street traffic. He began with a test dig on the SpaceX
                property in Los Angeles.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-family: georgia;">In late October of that year, Musk posted the first photo of his
                company's progress to his Instagram page. He said the 500-foot tunnel, which would generally run
                parallel to Interstate 405, would reach a length of two miles in approximately four months.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-family: georgia;">In May 2019 the company, now known as TBC, landed a $48.7 million
                contract from the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority to build an underground Loop system to
                shuttle people around the Las Vegas Convention Center.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-family: georgia;">Musk’s Tweet and SEC Investigation</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-family: georgia;"><br /></span></p>
        <p><span style="font-family: georgia;">On August 7, 2018, Musk dropped a bombshell via a tweet: "Am considering
                taking Tesla private at $420. Funding secured." The announcement opened the door for legal action
                against the company and its founder, as the SEC began inquiring about whether Musk had indeed secured
                the funding as claimed. Several investors filed lawsuits on the grounds that Musk was looking to
                manipulate stock prices and ambush short sellers with his tweet.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-family: georgia;">Musk’s tweet initially sent Tesla stock spiking, before it closed the day
                up 11 percent. The CEO followed up with a letter on the company blog, calling the move to go private
                "the best path forward." He promised to retain his stake in the company, and added that he would create
                a special fund to help all current investors remain on board.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-family: georgia;">Six days later, Musk sought to clarify his position with a statement in
                which he pointed to discussions with the managing director of the Saudi Arabian sovereign wealth fund as
                the source of his "funding secured" declaration. He later tweeted that he was working on a proposal to
                take Tesla private with Goldman Sachs and Silver Lake as financial advisers.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-family: georgia;">The saga took a bizarre turn that day when rapper Azealia Banks wrote on
                Instagram that, as a guest at Musk's home at the time, she learned that he was under the influence of
                LSD when he fired off his headline-grabbing tweet. Banks said she overheard Musk making phone calls to
                drum up the funding he promised was already in place.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-family: georgia;">The news quickly turned serious again when it was reported that Tesla's
                outside directors had retained two law firms to deal with the SEC inquiry and the CEO's plans to take
                the company private.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-family: georgia;">On August 24, one day after meeting with the board, Musk announced that
                he had reversed course and would not be taking the company private. Among his reasons, he cited the
                preference of most directors to keep Tesla public, as well as the difficulty of retaining some of the
                large shareholders who were prohibited from investing in a private company. Others suggested that Musk
                was also influenced by the poor optics of an electric car company being funded by Saudi Arabia, a
                country heavily involved in the oil industry.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-family: georgia;">On September 29, 2018, it was announced that Musk would pay a $20 million
                fine and step down as chairman of Tesla's board for three years as part of an agreement with the
                SEC.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-family: georgia;"><br /></span></p>
        <p><span style="font-family: georgia;"><b>Inventions and Innovations</b></span></p>
        <p><span style="font-family: georgia;"><br /></span></p>
        <h3 style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: georgia;">Hyperloop</span></h3>
        <p><span style="font-family: georgia;">In August 2013, Musk released a concept for a new form of transportation
                called the "Hyperloop," an invention that would foster commuting between major cities while severely
                cutting travel time. Ideally resistant to weather and powered by renewable energy, the Hyperloop would
                propel riders in pods through a network of low-pressure tubes at speeds reaching more than 700 mph. Musk
                noted that the Hyperloop could take from seven to 10 years to be built and ready for use.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-family: georgia;">Although he introduced the Hyperloop with claims that it would be safer
                than a plane or train, with an estimated cost of $6 billion — approximately one-tenth of the cost for
                the rail system planned by the state of California — Musk's concept has drawn skepticism. Nevertheless,
                the entrepreneur has sought to encourage the development of this idea.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-family: georgia;">After he announced a competition for teams to submit their designs for a
                Hyperloop pod prototype, the first Hyperloop Pod Competition was held at the SpaceX facility in January
                2017. A speed record of 284 mph was set by a German student engineering team at competition No. 3 in
                2018, with the same team pushing the record to 287 mph the next year.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-family: georgia;"><br /></span></p>
        <h3 style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: georgia;">AI and Neuralink</span></h3>
        <p><span style="font-family: georgia;">Musk has pursued an interest in artificial intelligence, becoming
                co-chair of the nonprofit OpenAI. The research company launched in late 2015 with the stated mission of
                advancing digital intelligence to benefit humanity.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-family: georgia;">In 2017, it was also reported that Musk was backing a venture called
                Neuralink, which intends to create devices to be implanted in the human brain and help people merge with
                software. He expanded on the company's progress during a July 2019 discussion, revealing that its
                devices will consist of a microscopic chip that connects via Bluetooth to a smartphone.&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-family: georgia;"><br /></span></p>
        <h3 style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: georgia;">High-Speed Train</span></h3>
        <p><span style="font-family: georgia;">In late November 2017, after Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel asked for
                proposals to build and operate a high-speed rail line that would transport passengers from O'Hare
                Airport to downtown Chicago in 20 minutes or less, Musk tweeted that he was all-in on the competition
                with The Boring Company. He said that the concept of the Chicago loop would be different from his
                Hyperloop, its relatively short route not requiring the need for drawing a vacuum to eliminate air
                friction.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-family: georgia;">In summer 2018 Musk announced he would cover the estimated $1 billion
                needed to dig the 17-mile tunnel from the airport to downtown Chicago. However, in late 2019 he tweeted
                that TBC would focus on completing the commercial tunnel in Las Vegas before turning to other projects,
                suggesting that plans for Chicago would remain in limbo for the immediate future.&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-family: georgia;"><br /></span></p>
        <h3 style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: georgia;">Flamethrower</span></h3>
        <p><span style="font-family: georgia;"><span style="background-color: #cfe2f3;">Musk also reportedly found a
                    market for The Boring Company's flamethrowers.</span> After announcing they were going on sale for
                $500 apiece in late January 2018, he claimed to have sold 10,000 of them within a day.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-family: georgia;"><br /></span></p>
        <h3 style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: georgia;">Relationship with Donald Trump</span></h3>
        <p><span style="font-family: georgia;">In December 2016, Musk was named to President Trump’s Strategy and Policy
                Forum; the following January, he joined Trump's Manufacturing Jobs Initiative. Following Trump’s
                election, Musk found himself on common ground with the new president and his advisers as the president
                announced plans to pursue massive infrastructure developments.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-family: georgia;">While sometimes at odds with the president's controversial measures, such
                as a proposed ban on immigrants from Muslim-majority countries, Musk defended his involvement with the
                new administration. "My goals," he tweeted in early 2017, "are to accelerate the world’s transition to
                sustainable energy and to help make humanity a multi-planet civilization, a consequence of which will be
                the creating of hundreds of thousands of jobs and a more inspiring future for all."</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-family: georgia;">On June 1, following Trump's announcement that he was withdrawing the
                U.S. from the Paris climate accord, Musk stepped down from his advisory roles.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-family: georgia;"><br /></span></p>
        <p><span style="font-family: georgia;">Personal Life-</span></p>
        <h4 style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: georgia;">Wives and Children</span></h4>
        <p><span style="font-family: georgia;">Musk has been married <b>twice.</b> He wed <b>Justine Wilson</b> in 2000,
                and the couple had <b>six children</b> together. In 2002, their first son died at 10 weeks old from
                sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). Musk and Wilson had five additional sons together: twins Griffin
                and Xavier (born in 2004) and triplets Kai, Saxon and Damian (born in 2006).</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-family: georgia;">After a contentious divorce from Wilson, Musk met actress Talulah Riley.
                The couple married in 2010. They split in 2012 but married each other again in 2013. Their relationship
                ultimately ended in divorce in 2016.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-family: georgia;"><br /></span></p>
        <h3 style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: georgia;">Nonprofit Work</span></h3>
        <p><span style="font-family: georgia;">The boundless potential of space exploration and the preservation of the
                future of the human race have become the cornerstones of Musk's abiding interests, and toward these he
                has founded the Musk Foundation, which is dedicated to space exploration and the discovery of renewable
                and clean energy sources.</span></p>
        <p><span style="background-color: #fcff01; font-family: georgia;">In October 2019 Musk pledged to donate $1
                million to the #TeamTrees campaign, which aims to plant 20 million trees around the world by 2020. He
                even changed his Twitter name to Treelon for the occasion.</span></p>
